Making publishing posts on Facebook easier and faster by using a bot posting to many pages very fast,
getting a list of group members out of Facebook group and even scheduling posts to different dates and
hours. The bot was built using pure python with selenium as the client, SQLite3 for database and PyQt5
for GUI.

# Dependencies
selenium~=4.2.0

pyqt5

pysqlite3

keyring

cryptography

# Installation

`pip install selenium pyqt5 pysqlite3 cryptography keyring`

or

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You also need to have mozilla geckodriver you can get it here ![geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver).

If you wish to use some other browser binary supported by selenium (i.e. Chrome), you need to edit 'Bot.py'.

replace :

`self.driver = webdriver.Firefox(options=self.options)` 

with something like :

`self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=self.options)`

Make sure you have geckodriver binary (or any other browser) in project directory or you might want to specify the path in `Bot.py`.

E.g. `self.driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path="/data/Drivers/geckodriver",options=self.options)`
